# TODO List for InterviewIQ Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix "Unknown at rule @tailwind" error by creating .csslintrc.json to ignore Tailwind directives
- [x] Fix blank screen on interview topic selection by correcting navigation path from "/interview/setup" to "/interview/config" in InterviewSelect.jsx

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the application to ensure Tailwind CSS is working properly (run `npm run dev` in InterviewIQ/client)
- [ ] Verify that selecting an interview topic now navigates to the config page without blank screen
